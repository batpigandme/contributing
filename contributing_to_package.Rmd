## What is this?

A `CONTRIBUTING.md` document has instructions for
contributing to the project. These are guidelines the maintainers would like
contributors to adhere to, and exist to make the process flow more smoothly. 

As a contributor you should try to make accepting your code as easy as you
can, this greatly increases the chance your contribution will be accepted.

## Prerequisites
  
  * For this guide to make sense, you'll need to be acquainted with Git and 
  GitHub. If you are not, see [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/) 
  by Jenny Bryan.


## Making a pull request

  * Uphold the design principles and package mechanics outlined below.  
  * When in doubt, discuss in an issue before doing lots of work.  
  * Make sure the package still passes `R CMD check` locally for you. 
  It's a good idea to do that before you touch anything, so you have a **baseline**.
  * Match the existing code style. For this purpose, you should follow the tidyverse style guide <http://style.tidyverse.org>.
  * Documentation: Update the documentation source, if your PR changes any 
  behavior. We use  [**roxygen2**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), 
  so you must edit the roxygen comments above the function; never edit 
  `NAMESPACE` or `.Rd` files by hand.
  * Website: Do not update the pkgdown-created website, i.e. the files 
  generated below `docs/`. We'll take care of that.
    + To update the roxygen documentation _without_ changing the pkgdown-created 
      website, you can run `devtools::document()`.
  





### View contributing as a relationship, not a transaction ###

The best way to be successful contributing to open source projects is to do so
repeatedly. This means cultivating trust between yourself and the maintainer by
multiple successful contributions. After a series of smaller contributions the
maintainer will be much more willing to review and accept more substantial
changes. As with any relationship being polite and considerate throughout will
go a long way to improve trust. If you instead view the contribution as a
solitary transaction to add your pet feature you are much less likely to be
successful.
