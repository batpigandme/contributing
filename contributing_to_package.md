Contributing to {package}
================

## Prerequisites

  - For this guide to make sense, you’ll need to be acquainted with Git
    and GitHub. If you are not, see [Happy Git and GitHub for the
    useR](http://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan.

## Making a pull request

  - Uphold the design principles and package mechanics outlined below.  
  - When in doubt, discuss in an issue before doing lots of work.  
  - Make sure the package still passes `R CMD check` locally for you.
    It’s a good idea to do that before you touch anything, so you have
    a **baseline**.
  - Match the existing code style. For this purpose, you should follow
    the tidyverse style guide <http://style.tidyverse.org>.
